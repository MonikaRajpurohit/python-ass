    "\n",
    "**Ans:**   As we  know pythone is widely used in industry and it is a way simple compare to other language ,here are  some key feature of pythone :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **data industry:**\n",
    "   It is widely used in the data or it industry due to its simplasity and easy to uderstand and to visualise and analysis of program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **lots of libraries:**\n",
    "   In python there are total 137000 library available and are easy to understand taskin diverse domain like machine learning and web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.** platform independence :**  \n",
    "   it can run on any operating system with minimal change and it also has large and active community.\n",
